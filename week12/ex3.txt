with buff size n = 20 bytes
time command shows as: 

real    0m0.003s
user    0m0.002s
sys     0m0.001s

for n = 10
real	0m0.002s
user	0m0.003s
sys	0m0.000s

if put O_SYNC mode for n = 10 we have

real	0m0.002s
user	0m0.002s
sys	0m0.000s

O_SYNC provides synchronized I/O file integrity completion, meaning
       write operations will flush data and all associated metadata to the
       underlying hardware.

To understand the difference between the two types of completion,
       consider two pieces of file metadata: the file last modification
       timestamp (st_mtime) and the file length.  All write operations will
       update the last file modification timestamp, but only writes that add
       data to the end of the file will change the file length.  The last
       modification timestamp is not needed to ensure that a read completes
       successfully, but the file length is.  Thus, O_DSYNC would only
       guarantee to flush updates to the file length metadata (whereas
       O_SYNC would also always flush the last modification timestamp
       metadata).
