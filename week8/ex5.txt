RAM can be represented as a sequence of bytes, each of which has its own unique address, 
called a physical address. It is these addresses that the processor ultimately uses when communicating with RAM. 

1) The process address space is significantly different from the physical RAM address space.

The point of virtual memory is that each process runs in its own virtual address space. Virtual address space 
is a real convenient for the process. 2)Firstly, the process creates a sense of exclusivity — because all the address 
space belongs only to him. 3)Secondly, it is no longer limited by the amount of physical memory — virtual memory can 
significantly exceed physical memory. As a result, the processes become isolated from each other and do not have the 
ability (even if desired) to "host" in the address space of the neighbor. 4)Physical memory is allocated as efficiently 
as possible-it does not depend on the virtual memory allocation of a single process.
