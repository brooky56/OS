Second program: out->Hello
		     \n
		     \n
This happend because when we call fork, we generate first child process, moreover this process inherit buffer mode from parent proces, in this case 
the created process will be busy executing the same code from exactly the same point as the original process. So we will execute printf("Hello") and then printf("\n")
twice by two child process.

First program: out->Hello
		    Hello
This happend because both created process will print "Hello" and then "\n", the main reason that the both process contain 
not printed "Hello" and "\n" in their buffer.
